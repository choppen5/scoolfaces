# ScoolFaces
(why the funky name?  I misspelled School when creating this repo!  And the domain was availible. Viola.)

ScoolFaces is a a small networking application for families in pre-school - elementary school (primary school in the UK).

The goal of the app is to build community in schools. In public schools in the US at least, the amount of parent participation in a school directly correlates to the sucess of that school.   Parent communities in school who work together can do amazing things.   Parents who socialize and get to know each other create better schools. They support the teachers, the kids have a network beyond the artificial confines of an educationa institution. The school raises more money, and kids do better. And people have fun. 

My childs school in San Francisco is a testamant to that, and the inspiration for this software.  The school, CIS DeAvila was started only 5 years ago, and an amazing community sprung up organically, from scared parents who were placed in a brand new school and taking a huge risk to send their kids to a new school. CIS developed a core community, of only a few familiys, that have seeded an incredible community and made CIS a top performing school in San Francisco in only a  few years.  And besides having an incredible principal and teachers, the main driving force was the parent community.  A community that got together to drink.  To talk.  To plan. To have fun. To support kids.  

ScoolFaces takes the core of that... getting parents to recognize and talk to each other, and trys to distill it into software.  As a parent of two kids, I have a hard time meeting and remembering the names of the kids and parents in my class. 

ScoolFaces was born out of that one key need - what are the names an faces of the parents and kids in my school?

The core initial funciton is to put a name and face with every kid, and parent in the classroom. Currently, there is a lot of school wide email lists, but you don't know the full name or face of a parent emailing. Likewise, you see kids in their school, don't know there name.


So this app will allow a parent to:

- Join the school(organization)
- Join a group(classroom) 
- -Create a profile of themselves (user)
- simple picture, name, bio, email 
- Create family members (kid(user), spouse(user)). Kids probably don't even get email addresses.
- Unlike most social networks, one user can create multiple people, grouped in a family, so the data model is different than average networking app. 
- There is light messaging, mostly email based. IE, if there are 20 parents in the room, a message posted or email gets emailed to them all. See messages on the board -- School wide emails (organization)
